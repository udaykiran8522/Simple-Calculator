Hey there, this is Uday Kiran, basically a developer, develops few short end sripts using python.
This program is basically a simple calculator, which calculates some of the arithmetic operations in between two numbers.
Prerequisites for running this code :
 1) Python ("pkg install python")
 2) Git ("pkg install git")
follow these steps to install my tool into your linux or termux environment :
 1) "git clone https://github.com/udaykiran8522/Simple-Calculator"
 2) "cd Simple-Calculator"
After hitting the above commands you  will be inside my tools directory. Now follow the below steps to execute this tool for your usage:
1) For operating operations in between multiple operands (i.e, 2 operands), like "+", "-", "x", "/", "^" and  "%". Use keywords "sum", "sub", "multi", "div", "power" and "mod" respectively.
For example, Command Line : "python calc.py n1 op n2"
                            Here, n1 = 1st number,
                                  op = operation to be implemented,
                                  n2 = 2nd number 
                                 
2) And for calculating the under root of any type follow the below steps.
Command Line : "python calc.py root n x"
              Here, n = number, on which under root gonna applied.
                    x = it's sayingly the prefix of the under root, that means "2", for the sqr. root and "3", for the cubth root, and so-on...
3) For Calculating the calculations of the mensuration part,
*) For Calculating the Area of any shape, the command-line is as below:
    "python calc.py area-shape x y"
              Here, "area-shape" means "area - square or area-triangle....and so-on like that."
                    "x" and "y" means the dimensions of the 2-D shapes. For Example for square, circle only one argument should be given (i.e, x(radius or side)). And 
                     for the shapes like rectangle, triangle... "x" and "y" both should be used (i.e, x(length or base) and y(breadth or height))
 *) The same method is applicable for calculating the perimeter of the 2-D shapes, but a small difference is the command line (i.e, "python calc.py perimeter-shape")
   (NOTE :- IN THE CASE OF CIRCLE USE THE ARGUMENT AS "circumference")
 4) For converting a Decimal number into a Binary number, command line is as follows:
     "python calc.py dec-bin decnum"
         Here, "decnum" means the decimal number that to be converted.

 And stay tuned.. Many more intersting and practically helpful script gonna add into this tools.
