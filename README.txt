Hey, this is Uday Kiran, basically a developer, develops few short end sripts.
This program is basically a simple calculator, which calculates some of the arithmetic operations in between two numbers.
For operating operations in between multiple operands (i.e, 2 operands), like "+", "-", "x", "/", and "%". Use keywords "sum", "sub", "multi", "div", and "mod" respectively.
And for calculating the under root of any type follow the below steps.
Command Line : "root n x"
              Here, n = number, on which under root gonna applied.
                    x = it's sayingly the prefix of the under root, that means "2", for the sqr. root and "3", for the cubth root, and so-on...
 And stay tuned.. Many more intersting and practically helpful tools gonna add into this script.
 For any suggestions and issues Contact me, through my personal blog 
 Untill then Bye-Bye..!
